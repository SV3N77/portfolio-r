Todo app was my first leap into learning and utilising more modern libraries for my web development journey.

### Features

- Add Todos
- Delete Todos
- Edit Todos
- Refetch updated Todos

Todo app was a great introduction into using more modern libraries in web development. In this project I had
learnt how to fetch data from an API and display that data using react-query and its ability to refrsh data.
I learnt to utilise an express backend with a json file as the database. I also used HeadlessUI to create the
add task modal.
