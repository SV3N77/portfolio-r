Umbrellurai is a side-scrolling Metroidvania style game where the player controls an umbrella-wielding samurai. It was
created for 'Game Studio 1' subject at UTS with a small team of 4.

#### For this project I was tasked in:

- #### Overseeing the project
  Setting up sprints, meetings and proofing the game design/code.
- #### Game Design
  Helped with the design of the game, such as the levels, art and mechanics.
- #### Game Art
  I made/designed all of the game art and animated each of the characters.

Umbrellurai was an amazing project which further extended my game development and project management knowledge. My role
in this project was the game design lead. In this project we had developed a great pace utilising the Agile methodology
during development. I made and designed all of the game art using Aesprite which is a tool for making pixel art and animations.

In addition to the techinical knowledge, Umbrellurai had helped me develop my interpersonal skills with communicating with my
team. I was proud of this project and what we had achieved in making the game.
