At Pitch'd, I worked as a frontend developer intern, building a jobs platform to help users find jobs easily. I was responsible for developing the user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience, and implementing features such as search, filters, and sorting.I developed key pages, including the homepage, jobs page, and application, and onboarding, with a focus on creating a seamless user experience and ensuring accessibility. Using the React framework Next.js, I built server-side rendered pages to improve performance and SEO. For styling, I implemented Tailwind CSS, which allowed for rapid development of responsive designs that provided a consistent look and feel across all devices. I also integrated AWS services, deploying static assets to S3 and utilizing CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN) to enhance performance and reduce latency. Additionally, I applied TypeScript to improve code quality and maintainability, leveraging strong typing to minimize runtime errors.
