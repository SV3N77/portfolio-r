This portfolio is an updated version of my previous portfolio using a more modern framework. It was an amazing
experience using content layer to input data to my projects. To add a new project to this would be simple to
just make a new markdown file. This is a major upgrade from my previous project which used HTML and CSS where
I just added html each time I needed to add a new project.

I plan to update this portfolio for any future projects I might pursue.
